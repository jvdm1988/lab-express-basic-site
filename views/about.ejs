    <div class="about">
    <p> James Trevor "Jamie" Oliver, MBE (born 27 May 1975) is a British celebrity chef and restaurateur.
      <br>He is most known for his typically English cuisine that has garnered him numerous television shows and restaurants.
      <br><br>
      Born and raised in the village of Clavering, Essex, he was educated in London before taking his first culinary engagement
      at Antonio Carluccio's Neal Street restaurant as a pastry chef. When he moved to serve as a sous chef at the River Cafe he
      was noticed by the BBC and in 1999 debuted his television show, The Naked Chef which was followed by his first cook book
      subsequently becoming the No. 1 bestseller in the UK. After his Naked Chef Series he was endorsed by multiple companies
      and expanded his television capacity to include a documentary called Jamie's Kitchen; garnering him an invitation from the
      Prime Minister to 10 Downing Street.
      <br><br> In June 2003, Oliver was honored as a Member of the Order of the British Empire.

      In 2005, Oliver initiated a campaign originally called Feed Me Better to move British schoolchildren towards eating healthy
      foods and cutting out junk food; this campaign was eventually backed by the British government. Soon after he launched his
      first high-end restaurant, Jamie's Italian, in Oxford in 2008 and hosted a TED Talk winning him the 2010 TED Prize. </div>
